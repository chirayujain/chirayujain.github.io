							<h1>Carbon Fiber Research</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic20.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A nose cone was designed by each member of the team on SolidWorks, a CAD modelling software. Various design constraints were taken into account for each design, including the size of the frame and impact attenuator, as well the Formula SAE regulations restricting the size of the nose cone. So that the amount of air flow to the radiators in each of the side pods would be maximized, designs that tapered to a vertical line were encouraged. Designs were required to be able to attach to the car at 6 specific locations, and a minimal drag coefficient was encouraged.</p>
							<p>In order to understand how carbon fiber works, our group was given a demonstration on how to make it, and then allowed to produce samples ourselves. In layman’s terms, very fine threads (or fibers) of carbon are woven together to create a fabric. The weave of the fabric varies, and consequently, so does the strength of the final product. The fabric absorbs a mixture of epoxy resin and hardener which, when allowed to dry with the woven carbon fibers, becomes a material much stronger and lighter than steel. </p>
							<p>Our group manufactured three different samples of a 8 x 8 inch square of double layered carbon fiber. The first sample was simply one square placed directly on top of another square, following the grain, in a vacuum bag. The second sample was also in a vacuum bag. However, the grain of the second layer’s fibers was diagonal to the grain of the first layer’s fibers. The grain of both the layers in the third sample lined up with each other, however the sample was not placed in the vacuum bag and was set to harden in the air. </p>
							<p>The samples were allowed to harden with more or less equal amounts of epoxy overnight, and were then inspected the following morning. The two samples that were set in the vacuum bag had a very thin profile of about .02cm, and were very flexible. It was notable that the sample which was stacked in the same direction was very easy to flex along the grain, but very difficult to flex against the grain. The sample that was stacked diagonally had a very uniform flexibility. The sample that hardened in air had an average thickness of .068cm, and was very hard and difficult to bend. Additionally the samples sealed in the vacuum had a very even texture with only minor imperfections, whereas the texture of the sample hardened in the air was very rough with several epoxy bubbles and creases on the fiber. Our group then cut into eight equally sized 1 inch coupons from our three samples for further testing.</p>
							<p>The ultimate tensile strengths of the different coupons were tested with an instron machine which measured applied force over time. The instron machine held the coupons on two ends and applied tension by pulling and stretching until the coupons broke. The data showed that the thick carbon fiber coupon withstood the most force (2500-4000 N) and deformed on average 1.6 mm before breaking. The cross-hatched coupon withstood the least amount of force (1400-4000) and had uneven breaking points. The evenly lined carbon fiber coupon had cleaner breaking points but withstood a mediocre load (2500-4000 N). </p>
							<p>	Our group is working on creating a scaled down prototype of a nose cone for the car. The main goal of our group is determine how to manufacture this prototype, and by extension, how to manufacture the final nose cone. The material that we are using to create the nosecone is carbon fiber, and one of our goals is to determine how to best manufacture the nose cone so that it is accurate to our designs. In addition, we wish to make the surface as smooth and seamless as possible so as to minimize the drag created by the nose cone. We are currently using a mold combined with a vacuum sealed bag in order to achieve this. The mold is constructed out of foam and is formed by a CNC mill. The carbon fiber is laid into the mold, coated in epoxy resin and then covered in a layer of perforated plastic and then a layer of fabric. The mold, with the carbon fiber and the epoxy, is then wrapped within a bag and vacuum sealed. Any excess epoxy is drawn out from the carbon fiber in order to minimize the amount present. This is done because the strength to weight ratio of epoxy is lower than that of carbon fiber. </p>
