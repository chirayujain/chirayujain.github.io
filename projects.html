                <h4>A HS Hackathon partnered with NASA</h4>
                <p>For the past 2 years I have been organizing a highschool hackathon for around 150 students.
                  We focus on providing hardware and data through NASA's open data portal for the students to hack with.
                  Our team works through NASA's Space Apps organization to run their first highschool event for students around
                  the world. https://www.facebook.com/spaceappsnextgen/

                <h4>The most successful HS hackathon on the planet</h4>
                <p>For its 4th year running, hackBCA will be one of the most innovative highschool hackathon
                  again. Created and planned solely by students, hackBCA is open to all high school students
                  who are interested in exploring computer science regardless of skill level.
                   I have been the main hardware director for the past two years, and this year I am a main board
                   member in charge of hardware as well as outreach to sponsors. We have consistently had
                  over 500 high schoolers attend 3:2 male to female ratio. We have worked with major companies
                  such as Intel, Reddit, Vine, Github, and Wolfram Alpha to provide the best hackathon experience
                  for everyone.

                annual tradition for the incoming freshmen. We spend one week teaching the fundamentals
                of computer science through hands on activities with  python, arduino, Html, CSS, and javascript.

                <p>For the past two years at the Bergen Makerspace, I have run build in events,
                and club meetings for BCA students to expand the reach of the e-NABLE community foundation.
                We also spend our time designing improvements and attachments for the various prosthetic hands.
